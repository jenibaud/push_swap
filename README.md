# push_swap

The push_swap project at 42 School involves implementing an algorithm to sort a stack of integers with the least number of operations.<br>
The goal is to create an efficient solution that sorts the stack using a limited set of operations, aiming for optimal performance.
The project focuses on algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as understanding sorting techniques and the importance of complexity.

For this project, i chosed to use the Radix algorithm and i got a 90/100 note.<br>
